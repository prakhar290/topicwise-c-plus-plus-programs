//A number is called silly if it can be represented as the sum of the square of consecutive natural numbers starting from 1.
//for a given number N, find the closest silly number. And if more than one answer exists return the minimum one.
//for example:-  N = 18 so output will be 14 because  (1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3) = 14
