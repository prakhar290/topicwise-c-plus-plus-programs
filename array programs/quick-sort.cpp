//Quick sort is a process of sorting in which we choose any element and put it in right position i.e the elements which are smaller than
//selected element they should be moved to it's left and those who are greater than it moved to it's right. This technique also uses 
//divide and conquor method as it is not necessary that all the elements which are moved to left and right of the selected number are 
//sorted so we divide it into parts first will have all the smaller elements before the selected element and second part will have 
//elements that are greater than the selected element.
//for ex- given array be like {6 3 9 5 2 8 7} the output should be the sorted given array i.e {2 3 5 6 7 8 9}
